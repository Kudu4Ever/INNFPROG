        Create a new HTML file called if1.html with standard HTML code ready.
        Create a variable that contains your name, and declare a variable you call print that you don't fill with any value yet.
        Then you create an if test that checks the following:
        if the variable contains exactly your name, fill the variable output with a text string similar to "My name is first name last name".
        if the variable does NOT contain your name, fill the variable output with a text string similar to "My name is not first name last name".
        PS: first name is replaced with the value from the first variable - and your last name is written as text.
        Finally, you print the contents of the print variable to a <p> tag. 
        Run the code and check if it prints the correct statement. Then try changing the value in the variable with your first name to something 
        else and run the code to verify that your if/else test works.

         //However, if the name contains anything other than "Sofie" (else), we should print "My name is not NAME Karlsen"
