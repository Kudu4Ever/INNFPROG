        Create a file called animals.html. Copy in the array animals from the file dyr.html from exercise 1. 
        Under the variable animals, create a new variable called animals that contains an array with the English 
        translations of the animals you have stored in animals.
        
        Create a variable text where you combine text strings and references to the arrays in animals and animals 
        to create a sentence ala "X1 is an animal. It is called Y1 in English. X2 is also an animal, which is 
        called Y2 in English.".

        Replace X1 and X2 with two arbitrary indexes from animals, for example 2 and 8.
         Replace Y1 and Y2 with values ​​from animals, so that the translations will be correct.

        Print the sentence with translations to a <p> tag with id "sentence".
